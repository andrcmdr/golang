Description:
	exp/template: don't panic on range of nil interface
	
	This avoids a non-obvious panic when range is used on a
	nil interface, and fixes it by behaving as if the range
	was empty.
	
	The new behavior is equivalent to the outcome of iterating
	on a nil map or slice, and is useful because it allows
	generic structures such as used in json (map[string]interface{})
	to behave correctly if a key generally set to a list or map
	isn't present.
