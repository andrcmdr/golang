Description:
	goinstall: handle $(GOOS) and $(GOARCH) in filenames
	
	This enables goinstall to handle .go and .c files (for cgo)
	which are named after the following patterns:
	
	    name_$(GOOS).*
	    name_$(GOARCH).*
	    name_$(GOOS)_$(GOARCH).*
	
	Files with those names are only included if the $(GOOS) and
	$(GOARCH) match the current system.
	
	**NOT READY FOR MERGE** The tests in this branch break
	the build due to existent bugs being fixed elsewhere.
Files:
	src/Make.cmd
	src/Make.inc
	src/cmd/goinstall/Makefile
	src/cmd/goinstall/parse.go
	src/cmd/goinstall/syslist_test.go
	src/run.bash
