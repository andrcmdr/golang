Description:
	filepath: new Abs function
	
	The new filepath.Abs function returns an absolute and
	clean representation of path.
	
	The choice of stating explicitly that it returns a clean
	version is based on the fact that joining relative paths
	commonly leads to dirty versions such as "/a/.",
	"/a/./b", etc.
	
	We might opt to Clean it only when the provided path is
	not detected to be absolute, but the fact that an absolute
	path is being passed to Abs is a clear indication that the
	developer got the input in an unknown state, so it feels
	good to stay simple and clean it up at all times.
