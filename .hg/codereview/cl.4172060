	codereview: fix clpatch with empty diffs
	
	Avoid passing the placeholder diff to hgpatch, so that
	clpatch-ing an empty diff grabs the metadata and warns
	about it being empty, rather than failing with a
	hard-to-debug problem ("mkdir: no such file or dir",
	no metadata, etc).
Files:
	lib/codereview/codereview.py
