Description:
	codereview: new clpatch --mine flag
	
	The new --mine flag will handle the downloaded patch
	and metadata as being authored by the user running the
	command, so that further actions like change -d work
	correctly.
	
	This change also prevents passing the placeholder diff
	to hgpatch, so that clpatch-ing an empty diff works
	correctly.
