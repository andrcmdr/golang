Mailed: False
Description:
	ld: don't attempt to build dynamic sections unnecessarily
	
	This prevents ld from generating zeroed symtab entries for
	sections that aren't going to be generated because dynamic
	linkage has been disabled (-d was used or no dynamic libs
	were seen).  Even though they were not explicitly added by
	doelf, the relocation process was making them reachable
	again.
	
	The windows head is being disconsidered for this because
	apparently it's not taking into account debug['d'].
