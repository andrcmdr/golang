Description:
	goinstall: handle .c files with gc when cgo isn't used
	
	As a data point, this enables goinstall to handle the standard
	syscall package almost unchanged (there's one file with the _bsd
	extension, and a .c file which isn't supposed to be compiled in).
Files:
	src/cmd/goinstall/make.go
