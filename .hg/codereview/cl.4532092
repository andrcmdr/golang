Description:
	cgo: restrict #cgo directives to prevent shell expansion
	
	Fixes issue #1879.
	
	Directives were not directly expanded, but since their
	content ended up in makefiles, further expansion would
	take place there.  This prevents such artifacts by
	restricting the set of characters that may be used in
	a directive value.
	
	To build the list of safe characters I went through the
	contents of /usr/lib/pkgconfig and extracted LDFLAGS
	and CFLAGS information, so hopefully this is a
	reasonable default to get started.
