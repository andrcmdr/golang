Description:
	reflect: simplify and optimize internal representation
	
	While profiling a large-scale deserialization through the
	mgo MongoDB driver, I ended up finding that the internal()
	function within reflect would always pop to the top.  This
	is caused by the fact that pretty much every function
	call to reflect would recompute the internal representation
	of a Value.
	
	This CL simplifies and optimizes this internal representation
	while retaining the same API and the same desired properties
	of the current design (no heap allocs, etc).
	
	In a trivial benchmark that explores a common reflect workflow
	(included in the CL) a 30%+ improvement may be perceived.
