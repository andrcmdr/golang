Description:
	path/filepath: New OS-specific path support
	
	The path package now contains only functions which
	deal with slashed paths, sensible for any OS when dealing
	with network paths or URLs.  OS-specific functionality
	has been moved into the new path/filepath package.
	
	This first change involves mainly the package splitting
	and adapting the existing code to the new convention.
	Existing bugs related to compatibility with Windows
	paths have been left untouched, but identified issues
	have already been flagged with BUG entries while the
	coversion was done, so that they may be more easily
	addressed in future CLs.
	
	As an exception, DirSeps and VolumeSeps have been
	renamed to Separator and VolumeSeparator, and PathSeps
	has been dropped for being redundant.
