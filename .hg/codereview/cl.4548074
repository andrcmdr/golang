	filepath: Abs must always return a clean path
	
	When I was first coding Abs, I wondered if people wouldn't
	expect the path to be consistently clean, even if the path
	passed in was already absolute.
	
	CL 4524078 has a potential problem based on exactly that
	assumption, so it feels like this behavior is indeed the
	most useful and least surprising.
