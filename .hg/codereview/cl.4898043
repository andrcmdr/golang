Description:
	exp/template: support field syntax on maps
	
	While using exp/template in practice, the syntax for
	indexing values using the "index" action was found to be
	very inconvenient for frequent use when handling dynamic
	data from maps such as the ones used with json and yaml,
	that use a type like map[string]interface{}.
	
	For these kinds of maps, the default handling of fields as
	{{.Field}} makes the task of handling the several references
	significantly more pleasant and elegant, and is equivalent
	to what's currently done in the "template" package and in
	other external packages (e.g. mustache).
	
	Even with this change, the index action is still relevant
	as it allows indexing maps in other scenarios where keys
	wouldn't be valid field names.
