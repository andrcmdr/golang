Description:
	sync: always wake up previously sleeping goroutines on Cond.Signal
	
	This changes the internal implementation of Cond so that
	it uses two generations of waiters.  This enables Signal
	to guarantee that it will only wake up waiters that are
	currently sleeping at the call time.
	
	Fixes issue 1648.
