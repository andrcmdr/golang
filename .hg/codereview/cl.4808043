Description:
	ld: remove overlap of ELF sections on dynamic binaries
	
	The dynamic ELF sections were pointing to the proper data,
	but that data was already owned by the rodata and text sections.
	Some ELF references explicitly prohibit multiple sections from
	owning the same data, and strip behaves accordingly.
	
	The data for these sections was moved out and their ranges are
	now owned by their respective sections.  This change makes strip
	happy both with and without -s being provided at link time.
	
	A test was added in debug/elf to ensure there are no regressions
	on this area in the future.
	
	Fixes issue 1242.
	Fixes issue 2022.
	
	NOTE: Tested on Linux amd64/386/arm only.
