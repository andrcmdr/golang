Description:
	runtime: don't use twice the memory with grsec-like kernels
	
	grsec needs the FIXED flag to be provided to mmap, which
	works now.  That said, when the allocation fails to be made
	in the specific address, we're still given back a writable
	page.  This change will unmap that page to avoid using
	twice the amount of memory needed.
	
	It'd also be pretty easy to avoid the extra system calls
	once we detected that the flag is needed, but I'm not sure
	if that edge case is worth the effort.
