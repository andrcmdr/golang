Description:
	ld: fix strip by removing overlap of sections
	
	The gosymtab and gopclntab sections were pointing to the proper
	data, but that data was already owned by the rodata sections.
	Some ELF references explicitly prohibit multiple sections from
	owning the same data, and strip behaves accordingly.
	
	The data for these sections was moved to after rodata, and the
	gosymtab and gopclntab sections now own their respective ranges.
	
	strip is happy now, both with and without -s being provided at
	link time.  Note that it won't remove these sections, since they
	are necessary at runtime for generating proper backtraces and
	similar introspection operations.
