Description:
	ld: fix ELF strip by removing overlap of sections
	
	The gosymtab and gopclntab sections were pointing to the proper
	data, but that data was already owned by the rodata section.
	Some ELF references explicitly prohibit multiple sections from
	owning the same data, and strip behaves accordingly.
	
	The data for these sections was moved to after rodata, and the
	gosymtab and gopclntab sections now own their respective ranges.
	
	This change makes strip happy both with and without -s being
	provided at link time.  Note that it won't remove these sections
	because they are still allocated, and that's by design since
	they are necessary at runtime for generating proper backtraces
	and similar introspection operations.
	
	Fixes 1242.
	
	NOTE: Tested on Linux 386/amd64/arm only.
