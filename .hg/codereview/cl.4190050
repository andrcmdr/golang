Description:
	gc: fix init of packages named main
	
	This change removes the special case which existed
	for handling the initalization of the main package,
	so that other modules named 'main' get properly
	initialized when imported.
	
	For doing so, cc (6c/6a/etc) has been changed so that
	only the first center dot is converted to a dot.
	Without this it's impossible to address an internal
	exported function from c or asm.
	
	Note that gotest of main packages will break in most
	cases without this.
