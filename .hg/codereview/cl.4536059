Description:
	template: support string, int and float literals
	
	This enables customizing the behavior of formatters
	with logic such as {"template"|import} or even
	{Field1 Field2 "%.2f 0x%X"|printf}
	
	There's an opportunity for parsing literals earlier,
	and thus saving the repeated cost of doing it on
	execution, at the cost of further refactoring.
	
	Thanks to Roger Peppe for some debate on this.
