Description:
	build: support versioning without hg
	
	CL 4873048 introduced the ability to build without hg and
	getting an "unknown" version.  While this approach works
	to avoid the hg dependency, it also means that every
	exported tree that is built without hg or .hg will have not
	only missing information, but will also be compatible to
	one another.  Considering that it is a common practice to
	remove the VCS data in distributions, I suggest we don't
	take this approach to avoid its consequences.
	
	This CL fixes the same problem in a different way.  If hg
	isn't usable, it falls back to using the content of a
	VERSION file at the top of the tree.  This file can be
	generated with "src/version.bash -save" while hg is still
	around.
	
	If hg is usable, the current semantics are preserved and
	the VERSION file is ignored.
	
	The error message when VERSION and hg are not available
	instructs users to handle it properly.
Files:
	src/version.bash
