Description:
	build: support versioning without hg
	
	CL 4873048 introduced the ability to build without hg and
	getting an "unknown" version.  While this approach works
	to avoid the hg dependency, it also means that every
	exported tree that is built without hg or .hg will have not
	only missing information, but will also be compatible to
	one another.  Considering that it is a common practice to
	remove the VCS data in distributions, I suggest we don't
	take this approach to avoid its consequences.
	
	This CL fixes the same problem in a different way: if a
	VERSION file at the top of the tree exists, use it at
	all times.  If it doesn't, fall back to using information
	from hg necessarily, and fail if that's not possible.  The
	error message when VERSION and hg are not available
	instructs users to handle it properly.
	
	The VERSION file can be generated with
	"src/version.bash -save" while hg is still around.
Files:
	src/version.bash
